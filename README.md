# Introduction

  - As web and mobile applications become more mature and complex, software engineers invent clever new ways of improving the interaction between client and server within an application. One of the biggest paradigm shifts over the last few years in this regard has been GraphQL, an open-source query language and runtime for manipulating APIs. GraphQL was designed by Facebook in 2012 (and released publicly in 2015) to solve various weaknesses with traditional REST architecture by making a new system that is declarative, client-driven, and performant.

  - In this article, you will learn what GraphQL is, familiarize yourself with important terminology and concepts of GraphQL, and discover how the GraphQL specification compares with the REST architectural style.
